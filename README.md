This C code implements a hash table with separate chaining collision resolution. It defines structures for nodes and the hash table itself. The hash function utilizes the djb2 algorithm to distribute keys evenly. Nodes are created and inserted into the hash table, with collisions resolved by appending nodes to linked lists. The search function retrieves values associated with keys. In the main function, key-value pairs are inserted, and values are searched and printed. Overall, the code provides a basic implementation demonstrating the functionality of a hash table with separate chaining.
